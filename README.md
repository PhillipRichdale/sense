#### Scythe Event Tracking and Notation
Sense (pronounced "Zenze") is a web-based open source event-tracker for the board-game Scythe. It implements a complete notation system and event-protocol standard for Scythe.

### Why a Scythe Notation System?
Scythe is a popular modern non-trivial board game that enjoys a larger following and a stable global scene of competetive play in leagues and tournaments. This makes a standardized notation and event tracking system feasible and useful.

Scythe is a boardgame with way less abstraction than chess or checkers. Thus it lends itself to more illustrative and human-compliant descriptions, which totally makes sense. The notation system isn't about replacing that, it's supposed to make notation standardized, brief, syntactically strict and automatable. The aim is to eventually be able to play against one another in an online chat. Or against a bot.
